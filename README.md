KEY INSIGHTS --
The Power BI dashboard reveals several actionable insights from the analyzed data:

🏆 Top-Performing Products & Categories
A small set of products contributes to a large portion (60–80%) of total sales.
Certain product categories consistently outperform others across all regions.

📍 Regional Performance Disparities
Northern and Western regions show strong revenue growth, while Southern zones lag behind.
Specific cities have unusually high sales but low profit margins — indicating cost inefficiencies.

📈 Sales Trends & Seasonality
Sales exhibit a clear upward trend in Q3 and Q4, likely due to seasonal demand or promotions.
Dip in sales observed post-festive season, signaling potential for post-sale retention efforts.

🕰️ Year-over-Year Growth
Revenue has grown steadily by ~12–15% YoY.
New product launches in Q2 led to noticeable spikes in customer acquisition.

📊 Customer Segmentation Insights
Majority of repeat customers belong to high-value segments.
A large share of revenue comes from only 20% of customers (Pareto Principle in action).

📉 Underperforming Areas
Some regions/products show stagnant or declining sales, suggesting a need for strategy review.
Low conversion rates from leads in certain territories.

🔮 Forecast Projections
Forecast model predicts ~10–13% growth in the next quarter.
Sales in Region X projected to exceed others if current trends continue.
